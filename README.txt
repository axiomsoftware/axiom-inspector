About Axiom Inspector:
-----------------------------------------

Axiom Inspector is a tool that we, Axiom Software, developed to make it easier for developers to get in and muck around. The idea is that you can run code, see the changes that are being made in realtime, and debug your code. We're utilizing the built in Rhino debugger to also do a number of debugging tasks such as breakpoints and stepping through code.


Usage:
-----------------------------------------

To use Axiom Inspector, grab thet source, and then place it in your <modules> directory.
